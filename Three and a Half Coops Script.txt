Three and a Half Coops Script:

*I'm just making a basic outline, since I think we all know the parts we did well enough to demo it.

To Start:

- Someone (whoever volunteers) introduces the app. Explains the game to Erik and so and so.
- At the front page Irbahim can explain the facebook login.
    - users can login to the app, we will either create a new user and persist into the db or if one exists do nothing
    - at the game index, the user will be retrieved from the Server and instantiated in the game instance
- At main menu, Ashley can explain the high scores popup, and Zach can explain the loading parts of the game
- Zach should come in and explain all the server and heroku stuff and how that works with the game.
    : once the main menu loads, the client requests the fire data to be delivered from the server
    : the server recieves this response and accesses the required data from the hosted Mongo database emits a response to       client
    : the client recieves the data and stores it inside of the Game class
    : during this process, the client querying its local data ever 100ms to check if the required data has been loaded 
      from the server yet.  Once it has, these queries are canceled and the 'Loading' button switches to 'Start Game' 
- We can start playing the game and Ashley can jump in and explain the timer, the score keeper, and the fire overlays. 
- Zach can also explain the game instance and general gameplay features. 
    : the GameInstanceInterface is designed to facilitate the addition of new variations on gameplay.  
- At the end Ibrahim can talk about score sharing.
    - at the end of every game the score gets persisted into the DB into your user scoreArray
    - in addition we have the option of sharing your score with your friends on your FB timeline
